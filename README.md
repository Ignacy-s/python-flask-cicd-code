# Python Flask CI/CD Project sub repo (Flask app repo)
Application code, Jenkinsfile and Terraform code for the Continuous
Deployment, for the [python flask cicd
project](https://github.com/Ignacy-s/python-flask-cicd), to be pulled
by Jenkins pipeline.

This is just a very simple Flask Web App, more a proof of concept than
anything of real use. You can learn more about this and the main repo
by reading the main repo's README.md which you can find
[here](https://github.com/Ignacy-s/python-flask-cicd/blob/master/README.md).

App code taken from [Corey Schafer's Python Flask Blog](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog).
